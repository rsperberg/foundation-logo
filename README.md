# Foundation Logo

A font containing the specific design of letters used for the Foundation logo, in the Apple TV+ series based on the Isaac Asimov books.

Since, by definition, only the seven letters used in the word ”Foundation“ comprise the glyphset of the logo, all the other characters, numbers, symbols and punctuation are conjectures.

One surprising aspect of the Foundation logo is that the Apple TV+ series has used two different logos:

<img src="reference-images/Foundation_Logo_version_w_undotted_O.jpg" alt="An alternate version of the Foundation logo, with different F, A and N designs and no dot for the O" title="An alternate version of the Foundation logo, with slightly different A and N designs, no dot for the Os and an interrupted stem in the F, which does not extend to the top arm">

And beyond that, the type design used in the title sequence is also used, when “Previously on Foundation” is announced.

<img src="reference-images/Foundation_Logo_previously_on_foundation.jpg" alt="Seen each week at episode beginning, 'Previously on Foundation' using characters that form the basis of the Foundation One and Foundation Titles fonts" title= "Seen each week at episode beginning, 'Previously on Foundation' using characters that form the basis of the Foundation One and Foundation Titles fonts">

The characters used in the word “Foundation” in the image above form the basis of the <a href="https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-titles-hand" title="Jump to Foundation Titles repo">Foundation Titles</a> font, and the other text is the basis for the <a href="https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-one" title="Jump to Foundation Titles repo">Foundation One</a> font, both OFL-licensed and both here on GitHub.  A <a href="https://github.com/rsperberg/foundation-screen" title="Jump to Foundation Screen repo">font</a> based on the type design seen on computer screens in Foundation is also planned.

Here is version 0.3 of Foundation Logo, with caps only but including alternate versions of E, F, K, P, S, W, X, Y and Z (coverage of the full Basic Latin codeblock).
